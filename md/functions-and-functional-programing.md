--

## Positional Arguments

```python
def func(arg1, arg2, arg3):
    pass

func(a, b, c)
```
- `arg1`, `arg2` and `arg3` are positional arguments
- When calling func exactly 3 arguments must be given, wrong number of args will result in a `TypeError`
- The order in the call determines which arg they are bound to
- The expressions (`a, b, c`) are evaluated before the call
- The value of `a` is bound to `arg1` in the body of func and so forth


--

## Named Arguments

```python
def func(arg1, named1=val1, named2=val2):

func(a, named2=b, named1=c)
    pass
```
- After the positional args, named args are allowed
- `val1` and `val2` are default values for those variables.
- Omitting named arguments in a call uses the default value
- Named arguments can be given out of order:
    - `func(a, named2=b)`
    - The default value, val1 will be bound to named1

--

## Default Arguments

- Default arguments are evaluated when the function is defined
- In all calls, the object that the expression evaluated to will be used.
- If the default is mutable, updates in one call effect following calls
- `def func(a=[])` Will mutate the default on each call
- Use None as the default to avoid mutation
```python
def func(a=None):
    a = a or []
```

--

## Memoization

- Memoization is an optimization technique that stores results of
function calls
- The previously computed answers can be looked up on later calls
- Use a dictionary default arg to store answers
- `def func(arg, cache={}):`
- Store answers in `cache[arg] = ans`
- Check for arg in cache before doing any work

---

# Args and KWArgs
<!-- .slide: data-background="img/argument-shadows.jpg" --> 

--

## *args

- A variable number of positional arguments can be specifed
- Use `*args` in between positional and named args
- Could use any identifier but args is conventional
- `def func(arg1, *args, named=val)`
- `args` is a tuple of 0 or more objects

--

## Required Keyword Args

- Any args after `*args` are keyword args
- If there is no default value specified, they are required keyword args
- `def func(*args, named):`
    - `named` is a required keyword arg
- To specify required keyword args without allowing variable positional args use `*`
- `def func(arg1, *, named)`
    - named is a required kwarg
    - func must take exactly one pos arg and one kwarg

--

## **kwargs

```python
def func(arg1, *args, named=val, **kwargs):
    pass
```
- Use `**kwargs` at the end
- Could use any identifier but kwargs is conventional
- kwargs is a dictionary of strings to values
- The keys of kwargs are the names of the keyword args
- `func(a, extra1=b, extra2=c)`
    - `arg1 = a`
    - `args = tuple()`
    - named gets the default object
    - `kwargs = {'extra1': b, 'extra2': c}`

--

## \*/\*\* in Function Definition or Assignment

- `def(*args)`: args is a tuple that can take 0 or more values
- `def(**kwargs)`: kwargs is a dictionary that can take 0 or more
key-value pairs
- `a,*var_name = range(5)`: var_name is list taking 0 or more
values


--

## \*/\*\* in Function Call

- `func(*expr)`
    - `expr` is an iterable
    - It gets unpacked as the positional arguments of `func`
    - Equivalently:
    ``` python
    seq = list(expr)
    func(seq[0], seq[1], ...)
    ```

- `func(**expr)`
    - expr is a dictionary of form `{'string': val, ...}`
    - It gets unpacked as the keyword arguments of `func`
    - Equivalently 
    ```python
    func(string=val, ...)
    ```

--

## Annotations
```python
def func(name: str, hight: float = 1.90)-> int:
    pass
```
- Function arguments and return values can be annotated
- Python does not enforce any meaning to annotations
- Read further on [PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) and [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)


---

# Global variables
<!-- .slide: data-background="img/global.jpeg" --> 

--

## Closures
```python
a = 42
def func():
    print(a)
```
- A function that knows about variable defined outside the function
- `func` is a closure because it knows about `a`
- Closures are read-only: adding `a += 1` inside `func()` will result in `UnboundLocalError` exception

--

## Global
```python
a = 42
def func():
    global a
    a += 1
```
- Changing global state can be dengerous, so Python requires you to declare it explictly   
- `global` can circumvent read-only closures
- the `global` keyword declares certain variables in the current code block to reference the global scope
- Variables following global do not need to be bound already

--

## Nonlocal
```python
def outer():
    a = 42
    def func():
        nonlocal a
        print(a)
        a += 1
    func()
```

- `nonlocal` declares certain variables in the current code block to reference the nearest enclosing scope.
- If the nearest scope is the global scope then nonlocal raises a `SyntaxError`
- See [PEP 3104](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/)

#Functional Programming
<!-- .slide: data-background="img/lambda.jpg" --> 
--

## Background (1)

- Functional programming started with lambda(&Lambda;) calculus
- Alternative to Turning machines for exploring computability
- Expresses programs as functions operating on other functions
- Functional programming attempts to make it easier to reason about program behavior
- No data states allows for easier multi threaded programing 

--

## Background (2)
- Python data is mutable and allows side-effects
- Has some functional concepts
- Not an ideal functional programming environment

--

## First Class Functions
- A higher order function is a function that:
    - Takes a function as one of its inputs
    - Outputs a function

- You can use functions anywhere you would use a value
- Functions are immutable so you can use them as dictionary keys
- Functions can be the return value of another function

--

## &lambda; (lambda) Functions
```python
f = lambda x: x + 1
```
- Anonymous functions are function objects without a name
- lambdas can have the same arguments as regular functions:
`lambda arg, *args, named=val, **kwargs: ret`
- lambdas must be one-liners and do not support annotations
- 'syntatic suger' to pass short functions to other functions.

--

## Higher Order Functions
- The most common are `map` and `filter`
- `map(f, seq)` returns an iterator containing each element of `seq` but with `f` applied
- `filter(f, seq)` returns an iterator of the elements of seq where `bool(f(seq[i]))` is `True`


--

## Functions as Keyword Args

- Many functions will accept another function as a kwarg `sorted(seq, key=f)`
- `sorted` will call `f` on the elements to determine order
- The elements in the resulting list will be the same objects in seq
- Have the key return a tuple to sort multiple fields
- `min(seq, key=f)` and `max(seq, key=f)` behave similarly
- This is a good spot for lambda

--

## Partial Application
```python
from functools import partial
def add(x, y): 
    return x + y

add_3 = partial(add, 3)
```

- Partial application creates a new function by supplying an existing function with some of its arguments

---

#decorators
<!-- .slide: data-background="img/decorators.jpg" --> 

--

## Decorators

- Decorators are transformations on functions
- A function that takes in a function and returns a modified function
```python
@dec
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
```
- Is equivalent to:

```python
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
func = dec(func)
```

--

## Decorator Arguments

- A decorator can take arguments

```python
@decmaker(argA, argB, ...)
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
```
- Is equivalent to:

```python
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
func = decmaker(argA, argB, ...)(func)
```

--

## Multiple Decorators
```python
@dec1
@dec2
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
```

- Is equivalent to:

```python
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
func = dec1(dec2(func))
```

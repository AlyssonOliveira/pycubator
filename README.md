# Pycubator

Live slides are at [pycubator.com](http://pycubator.com)

Pycubator (Python incubator) is a collection of slides for teaching Python.
These slides are meant to be used in a teacher-led classroom, but also, put a strong emphasis on student
exploration and participation.

## The zen of pycubator
-   Talk less, practice more.
-   Real world examples

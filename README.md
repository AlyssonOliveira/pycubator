[live slides][slides]

Pycubator is a collection of classes for a 3 day Python training based on MD and revealjs.
These slides are meant to be used in a teacher-led classroom, but put a strong emphasis on student
exploration and participation.

These slides are built upon our experience as Python instructors. *Work in progress*.

## The zen of pycubator
-   Talk less, practice more.
-   Real world examples

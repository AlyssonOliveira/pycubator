# pycubator

Python incubator training course materials. See [live slides](http://noamelf.github.io/pycubator/slides/).
These slides are meant to be used in a teacher-led classroom, but put a strong emphasis on student
exploration and participation.

These slides are built upon our experience as Python instructors. Work in progress.

## The zen of pyicubator
-   Talk less, practice more.
-   Real world examples
